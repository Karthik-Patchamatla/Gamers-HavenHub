        "description": "The GeForce GTX 1080 Ti was an enthusiast-class graphics card by NVIDIA. Built on the 16 nm process, and based on the GP102 graphics processor, in its GP102-350-K1-A1 variant, the card supports DirectX 12. This ensures that all modern games will run on GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. The GP102 graphics processor is a large chip with a die area of 471 mm² and 11,800 million transistors. Unlike the fully unlocked TITAN Xp, which uses the same GPU but has all 3840 shaders enabled, NVIDIA has disabled some shading units on the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti to reach the product's target shader count. It features 3584 shading units, 224 texture mapping units, and 88 ROPs. NVIDIA has paired 11 GB GDDR5X memory with the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, which are connected using a 352-bit memory interface.",
